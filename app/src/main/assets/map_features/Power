<h1>Power</h1>
<p>These are used to map electrical power generation and distributions systems. See the page titled Power for an introduction on its usage.
</p>
<p>[<b>power</b>=<b>plant</b>]<br>A place/industrial facility where power is generated. Individual generating units within the facility should be tagged as power=generator.</p>
<p>[<b>power</b>=<b>cable</b>]<br>A way following the path of underground cables, such as the local 0.4 kV network between transformer stations, distribution boxes and cable connection points, or sea cables. Not to be confused with non-power supply cables such as cables for telecommunication. May be combined with voltage=*, circuits=* and location=*.</p>
<p>[<b>power</b>=<b>compensator</b>]<br>Several kind of power devices used to insure of power quality and network resilience.</p>
<p>[<b>power</b>=<b>converter</b>]<br>An HVDC converter converts electric power from high voltage alternating current (AC) to high-voltage direct current (HVDC), or vice-versa.</p>
<p>[<b>power</b>=<b>generator</b>]<br>A device used to convert power from one form to another. Use in combination with generator:source=*, generator:method=* and generator:output=*.</p>
<p>[<b>power</b>=<b>heliostat</b>]<br>A mirror of a heliostat device.</p>
<p>[<b>power</b>=<b>insulator</b>]<br>A device to protect a power line from grounding on supports</p>
<p>[<b>power</b>=<b>line</b>]<br>A way following the path of (overground) power cables. For minor power lines with poles and not towers, you may want to use power=minor_line. Useful combinations: voltage=*, cables=* and wires=*. Please see the respective feature pages for details.</p>
<p>[<b>line</b>=<b>busbar</b>]<br>Determines a power=line to a busbar.</p>
<p>[<b>line</b>=<b>bay</b>]<br>A bay connects an incoming circuit to a busbar assembly.</p>
<p>[<b>power</b>=<b>minor_line</b>]<br>A way following the path of (overground) minor power cables, 
supported by poles and not towers/pylons. (This isn't quite so simple, 
as sometimes larger towers are replaced by smaller poles made with a 
stronger material; a better distinction might be based on voltage).</p>
<p>[<b>power</b>=<b>pole</b>]<br>Poles supporting low to medium voltage lines (power=minor_line) and high voltage lines (power=line) up to 161,000 volts (161 kV).</p>
<p>[<b>power</b>=<b>portal</b>]<br>Power supporting structure composed of vertical legs with cables between them attached to a horizontal crossarm</p>
<p>[<b>power</b>=<b>catenary_mast</b>]<br>A catenary mast supports system of overhead wires used to supply electricity to electricaly powered vehicle equipped with a pantograph.</p>
<p>[<b>power</b>=<b>substation</b>]<br>A tag for electricity substations. These provide voltage 
step-up/step-down, switching, conditioning, etc. Substations may be 
large facilities (up to several acres) for very high voltage 
transmission lines or just small buildings or kiosks near the street for
 low voltage distribution lines. Useful combinations: voltage=*, substation=* and location=*, see the feature page for details.</p>
<p>[<b>power</b>=<b>switch</b>]<br>A tag for electricity switches which are devices which allow 
operators to power up & down lines and transformer in substations or
 outside.</p>
<p>[<b>power</b>=<b>terminal</b>]<br>Point of connection between overhead power lines to buildings or walls</p>
<p>[<b>power</b>=<b>tower</b>]<br>For towers or pylons carrying high voltage electricity cables. 
Normally constructed from steel latticework but tubular or solid pylons 
are also commonly used. Should not be used for medium or low voltage 
electricity conductors carried on single wooden poles which might be 
tagged power=pole. See power=tower for detailed tagging of tower types.</p>
<p>[<b>power</b>=<b>transformer</b>]<br>A static device for transferring electric energy by inductive 
coupling between its windings. Large power transformers are typically 
located inside substations.</p>
<p>[<b>power</b>=<b>User Defined</b>]<br>All commonly used values according to Taginfo</p>
