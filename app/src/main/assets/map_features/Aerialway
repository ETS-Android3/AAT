<p>[<b>aerialway</b>=<b>cable_car</b>]<br>Cablecar or Tramway.
 Just one or two large cars. The traction cable forms a loop, but the

<p>[<b>aerialway</b>=<b>chair_lift</b>]<br>Chairlift.
 Looped cable with a series of single chairs (typically seating two or 
four people, but can be more). Exposed to the open air (can have a 
bubble). This implies oneway=yes (drawn upward).  Any two-way chairlifts should be tagged oneway=no.</p>
