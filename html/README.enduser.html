<h1>Map Tiles</h1>
<p>
AAT does not remove any downloaded map tiles. This is to...
<br>-reduce network traffic as much as possible.
<br>-reduce battery drain.
<br>-speed up the map view.
<br>-(theoretically) share map tiles with other applications.
</p><p>
This means that you have to remove old tiles manually from time to time.
You can select an appropriate <b>cache directory</b> from the settings. Preferably this directory would be on external or internal mas storage that can also be accessed from your PC.
</p>

<h1>Where to find files?</h1>
<p>
AAT let's you create and view files in GPX format. This files are exchangeable with many other applications. They can also be edited in a text editor. 
These and other files are stored in subdirectories of the <b>data directory</b>. You can choose the location of the <b>data directory</b> from the settings.
The structure of the <b>data directory</b> is as follows: 
</p><p>
<br><b>aat_data/activity[0-4]</b> - tracked activities
<br><b>aat_data/log</b>           - activity that gets tracked at the moment
<br><b>aat_data/nominatim</b>     - search result from OpenStreetMap Nominatim
<br><b>aat_data/osm_features</b>  - OSM Features original file and parsed files
<br><b>aat_data/overlay</b>       - overlays such as planned tracks or search results
<br><b>aat_data/overpass</b>      - queries from the OSM Overpass server
<br><b>aat_data/SRTM</b>          - downloaded altitude information from the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission
